# Edit reply templates

Editing a reply template can mean one of two things:

* When [replying to a request and use a template][1], you are free to edit the content of the message before you send it to the customer.
* When you create or edit the template itself, you can edit its properties, including amending the reply template text. This type of editing is described below.
