[!include[Intro](includes/contacts-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Contact** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that contact.

To move between contacts, click the previous/next buttons - ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] - at the bottom right of the cards

You can [search][8] for specific contacts based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new contacts.

## Section tabs on Contact

The bottom of the **Contact** screen contains five default [section tabs][9]:

* **Activities**
