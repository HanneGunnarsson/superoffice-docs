# Overview

## Prepare your CRM implementation

Before you start importing data and configuring the system, we suggest you evaluate what you want to change in the user interface. The CRM system should support your business processes and support your users, as well as improve reporting in your company.

Preparing the implementation of the CRM system involves, first of all, considering your plans and goals for your CRM initiative and making sure your CRM system supports those goals.

Your role as an administrator is vital here, because it is the most important role in making a CRM implementation successful.

When you’re planning your CRM configuration, it is important to define your data segmentation needs. You also need to outline which data fields you need to track in various reports.

It’s important to note that you can use all the information you register in the system as search criteria when you create target groups for call lists or mailings. Therefore, you should decide what criteria you want to segment your contacts on.

## Common things to edit

* **Categories:** You may want to classify companies into main target groups. It can be Customer, Prospect, Supplier, Partner. (To edit them, go to Lists and edit the Category list).

* **Business:** You can edit the list of industries you register companies in. It can be Transport, IT, service, production and so on. (To edit industries, go to Lists, and edit the Business list).

* **Interests:** On both company and contact you can edit the list for interests. It can be different types of accounts for company and type of roles for the contacts.

* **Subscription type:** All contacts in your SuperOffice CRM have the option to maintain their own type of subscriptions. These types are much used when creating selections and sending out mailings.

To review important considerations for the configuration, please [download your configuration preparation document][2]. When you have answered the questions in the document, you'll have the answers you need to configure your system.

When you are done with the preparation for your CRM implementation, it’s time to create and [manage your CRM users][1].
