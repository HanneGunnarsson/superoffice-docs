## Filter data in the archives

A great way to find information quickly is by using filters. Using a filter will reduce the amount of information you are looking at. Making it faster to find what you are looking for. Learn how you can filter the information you need from any archive in SuperOffice in the how-to.

Every archive in SuperOffice contains a Settings button on the right-hand side. When you click the Settings button a new dialog will appear. This dialog allows you to enable filters for this archive.

The filters you use, are only visible for you and you can add and remove filters at any time.

Every archive in SuperOffice contains a Settings button on the right-hand side. When you click it, a new dialog will appear. This dialog allows you to enable for this archive.

The columns you use to group your information, are only visible for you and you can add and remove as many groups as you like.
