# Edit privacy confirmation email

According to the GDPR, individuals have the "right to be informed". This means that they are entitled to be notified either in advance or within 30 days after that their personal details have been collected.

The GDPR stipulates that individuals are entitled to be informed (a) that an organization intends to store their personal data, and (b) what the organization intends to use their data for.

You can create and add as many privacy confirmation emails as you need in the Settings and Maintenance module of SuperOffice CRM.

There you can also add the same email template in as many languages as you need.

The privacy confirmation email template is a **email template**, which is created and edited in a similar way as document templates in Settings and maintenance.

## Edit the default template

1. Go to Settings and maintenance and click on **Lists**. Find the Email template list and the template for "Privacy confirmation email".

2. Double click to open the **Edit list item** dialog where you can change the name, description and so on.

3. Click the **Edit** button to open the HTML editor where you can change the email content. When you are finished editing, click **Save**.

4. Click **Save** again to return to the Email template list.

    The new edited version is now ready and can be used immediately.
