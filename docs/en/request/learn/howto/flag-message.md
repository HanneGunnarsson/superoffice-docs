# Keep track of messages

Complex requests can take a lot of time to solve. This can involve a lot of communication between the customer and multiple request handlers.

To make it easier to find and sort multiple messages in a request, you can flag important messages and filter the message list.

## Flagging a message

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Click the **Messages** tab.
3. Click the grey flag button (![icon][img1]) to mark a message. The flag turns red (![icon][img2]). The message is now "flagged".

## Filtering messages

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Click the **Show...** button in the top right corner.
3. Select the wanted filter, the number of messages (x) indicates how. The messages are filtered based on your filter option.
