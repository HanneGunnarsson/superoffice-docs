# Reply to customer

In request handling, your most important task is to respond to enquiries.

1. [Open the request][1].
1. Click ![icon][img1] **Reply** or ![icon][img5] **Reply to all**. A new message is created and the contact is automatically added as a recipient in the **To** field.
1. Type in the [message][2] you want to add to the request.
1. Since this message should be visible to the customer, verify that **External** appears in the toolbar at the bottom of the tab.
1. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as [attachments to the request][2].
1. Click **Send**. The message is sent to the customer.

## Add reply templates to messages

When you respond to an customer enquiry, you can save time by using a reply template as your basis.

1. Go to the **Message** tab, as described above.

1. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the reply template.

1. Click the **Add text** button ![icon][img3] , and select what to insert in the message.

1. In the list that appears, first click **Reply template** and then the entry you want.

1. Review the text and make any adjustments.

> [!TIP]
> You can also hover the reply template (or FAQ) to preview the selected item before you paste it.
