# Search options

SuperOffice CRM contains several different search tools:

* [FastSearcher][3]
* [The Find button][1]
* [Free-text search field][2]

## Using FastSearcher

You can use [FastSearcher][3] or the [history list][5] to search for companies, sales, projects, and selections.

**FastSearcher** can be found either in the **Navigator** menu by pressing on the company, contact, sales, project or selection to open a search field, or within pop-up dialogs to search for companies, contacts, sales, projects and selections.

It will quickly make you a list that match your search words and it’s a great feature to check your database for possible duplicates before adding a new company or contact.

### FastSearch tips

You can use %% to see all records in a certain module, like all companies, all selections, all projects.

If, for example, you want to see all the document templates available in SuperOffice CRM, go to the **+New** menu and click **Document**. In the top field in the document screen, which indicates types of document templates, type %%. You will then see a drop-down list that includes the full list of document templates available.

## Using the Find button

If you click the **Find** button on the top bar, you open the [Find screen][1], where you can search for data in SuperOffice.

The Find button helps you find records based on any criteria from companies, contacts, projects, selections, sales, products, follow-ups, documents and requests.

## Using free-text search

Use the [free-text search][2] search field in the upper-right corner to search for any text that users have entered into SuperOffice CRM.

> Want to see a list of all your contacts? Click on the **Selections** icon in the left-side navigator panel and search for “All Contacts” to see a pre-configured selection.

## Use typical searches as a starting point

A typical search is a pre-defined search that we’ve set up for you, so you can see what other users typically search for. Each data set in the Find screen contains a list of typical searches that are ready to be used.

A typical search is a great way to start looking for data in SuperOffice CRM. You can find typical searches by clicking underneath the group of data you are interested in. Containing pre-set search criteria, typical searches can be used as they are, modified or expanded.

As an example, let’s take a look at a typical search called "My overdue follow-ups". This search will give you a list of all the activities that you haven’t completed yet, which are as, a result, overdue.

When you set up the search criteria for this search, you can decide which type of activities you want to search for.

Typical searches are there to help you get started and create your own search of CRM data. After you’ve selected a typical search, you can add and edit the search criteria. And once you’ve created a useful search that you’d like to use again, you can save it as a selection.
