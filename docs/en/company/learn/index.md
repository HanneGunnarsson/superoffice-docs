# Companies

All information related to a company – be it your customer, partner or supplier – is stored on the Company card/screen in SuperOffice CRM. This card provides you with an instant snapshot of the company in one screen.

The bottom of the screen contains the following [default section tabs][8]:

Everything you want to find out about a company is available from a single screen.
