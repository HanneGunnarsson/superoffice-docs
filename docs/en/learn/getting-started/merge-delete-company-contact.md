# Merge or delete companies and contacts

To be able to be efficient in the work with customers and contacts, it is vital to have a "clutter free" environment. This means delete unused companies and contacts, and merge duplicated companies and contacts.

When you add new companies and contacts, make sure you double check that they are not added before. And off course, make sure you add correct information on companies and contacts.

## Merge companies and contacts

If you find duplicated information, go on and merge them as soon as possible, to make sure that it's easier to find the correct company and contact. You can also move a contact if he/she are added on the wrong company card. This is to prevent duplicates in the future.

## Delete company and contacts

When you have added wrong or duplicated information, it may be a good idea to delete a contact. There are several ways to do this.

**Tasks:**

* [Delete a company and associated data][4]
* [Delete a contact][5]
* [Bulk delete contacts and/or companies at once with selection][6]

When you have many contacts or companies you have to delete, the best way to mass delete them, is to add them into a new selection, and use the Delete tasks on the Task menu.

On the selection, click on the Task button and select one of the wanted Delete functions
