# Company

![Company screen -screenshot][img3]

[!include[Intro](includes/company-screen-intro.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> [Contacts][1] that are not associated with a company, can be found in the **Contact** screen.

[!include[Intro](../includes/company-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Company** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that company.

To move between companies, click the previous/next buttons (![icon][img2] ![icon][img1]) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can search for specific companies based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new companies and contacts.

## Section tabs on Company

The bottom of the screen contains the following [default section tabs][8]:

* **Contacts**
* **Relations**
* **Projects**
